        <section>
            <div>The trends shaping electric usage are multifaceted and reflect the evolving landscape of energy consumption, technological advancements, and societal preferences. Below are explanations of some key trends influencing electric usage:</div>

            <ul>
                <li><h4>Global Consumption Trajectory:</h4><p>Despite efforts to improve energy efficiency and conservation, global electricity consumption continues to rise steadily. This trend is primarily driven by population growth, urbanization, and industrialization, particularly in emerging economies. As more people move to urban areas and economies expand, the demand for electricity increases to power homes, businesses, and industries.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Renewable Energy Integration:</h4><p>
                    One of the most significant trends in recent years is the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This shift is driven by several factors, including environmental concerns, declining costs of renewable technologies, and supportive government policies. As renewable energy becomes more accessible and cost-effective, it displaces conventional fossil fuel-based generation, leading to a greener electricity grid.

                <li>
                    <h4>Smart Technologies Revolution: </h4>
                    <p>
                        The integration of smart technologies into the electricity grid is revolutionizing how electricity is generated, distributed, and consumed. Smart meters, IoT-enabled devices, and energy management systems enable real-time monitoring and control of electricity usage, allowing consumers to optimize their energy consumption, reduce wastage, and lower costs. Additionally, smart grids improve grid reliability, efficiency, and resilience by facilitating two-way communication between utilities and consumers.

                <li>
                    <h4>Electrification of Transportation:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The electrification of transportation, particularly in the form of electric vehicles (EVs), is reshaping electricity demand patterns. As the automotive industry transitions away from internal combustion engines towards electric propulsion, the demand for electricity to power EVs is expected to increase significantly. This trend presents both opportunities and challenges for the electricity sector, requiring infrastructure upgrades, grid modernization, and innovative solutions for managing peak demand.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Decentralization and Distributed Generation:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Another notable trend is the decentralization of electricity generation and the rise of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems. Advances in technology, coupled with policy incentives and declining costs, are empowering consumers to generate their own electricity locally and reduce reliance on centralized power plants. This trend towards decentralization has implications for grid management, regulatory frameworks, and business models within the electricity sector.
